3) Let see what are all debt indicator are there in our data

4) Now let see which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what is that amount:

From this we can say that China has maximum amount of debt in all debt indicator in our data

5) Now that we have summary of data, let's take look at average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators:
![image](https://github.com/Shubham17-arch/International_debt_analysis/assets/63954721/4bfa6a11-882f-43d8-93a5-43f1e4c47d0f)

6) Now that we have average amount of debt by all indicators let's find out which all debt indicators are most common:
![image](https://github.com/Shubham17-arch/International_debt_analysis/assets/63954721/bca2d22b-bc2b-4a1d-a347-977b0e932f74)

From above result we can see that first 6 debt indicators are nearly has every countrafty. Now from the average debt owed by countries data we can see that there is huge difference in the amount of debt after second  indicator. Also with this result we can say that all countries are going throigh this 6 common economic issues.

7) So lets see which country has highest amount of debt  belong to this long term category of debt as this first 2 indicators looks more severe compared to other indicators.

8) Let's find out the maximum amount of debt across the indicators along with the respective country names:

with this can be able to find out other plausiable economic issue that can countries are going through.

So in this SQL analytics project we took a look at debt owed by countries accross the globe. With this we are able to found out statistics summary about data and some interesting facts about the data.
